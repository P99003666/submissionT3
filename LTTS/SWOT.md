**SWOT Analysis**

Strengths:

- Easy to implement conversions.
- Binary coded decimals take as many bits as it requires.

Weakness:

- Float point conversions cannot be done. 
- Calculations with these binary numbers are more complex.
- The major disadvantage of binary number is difficult to read and write for humans because of large number of binary for equivalent decimal number.

Opportunities:

- Binary coded decimal system is used all over the worlds computing systems.
- Binary coded decimal system provides a safety range for reliability.

Threats:

- Binary system may become obsolete in future.
- Binary and decimal systems are not used because of their complexities in their calculation.
