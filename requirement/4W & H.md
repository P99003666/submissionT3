**Converting Decimal to Binary, Binary to Decimal, Binary to Octal and Octal to Binary**

**What**-Converting a number written in binary to a number system with another base like decimal and also converting a decimal number to a binary and then again convert into binary to octal and octal to binary.

**Where**-Then binary numbers are commonly used in digital and computer circuits and are represented by either a logic “0” or a logic “1”. Binary numbering systems are best suited to the digital signal coding of binary, as it uses only two digits, one and zero, to form different figures.

**Why**-We use converter because Computers use Binary and they can only read and store an on or off charge. To keep calculations simple and convert into binary online, computer use the Binary system.

**When**-  The digits: 0 and 1, are used by binary code to represent computer text or instructions and a bit string is assigned to each symbol or instruction.

**How**- To convert decimal from binary it will start with the number and divide it by 2 and then it will give of the quotient and the remainder. Continue dividing the quotient by 2 until you get a quotient of zero. Then just write out the remainders in the reverse order.

And in binary to decimal it will start from leftmost digit from the input. From binary number Starting from the left, double the previous total and add the current digit. Double the current total and add the next leftmost digit then it will convert into decimal.

In binary to octal first take the given binary number then multiply each digit by 2n-1 where n is the position of the digit from the decimal The resultant is the equivalent decimal number for the given binary number then Divide the decimal number by 8 then whatever the reminder is Continue the above two steps with the quotient till the quotient is zero then write the reminder in the reverse order. This is how it will convert into octal.

In octal to binary take a given octal number then convert the given octal number into its equivalent decimal number and then convert the decimal into binary.




**History-**

The modern binary number system, the basis for binary code, was invented by Gottfried Leibniz in 1689 and appears in his article *Explication de l'Arithmétique Binaire*. The full title is translated into English as the "Explanation of the binary arithmetic", which uses only the characters 1 and 0, with some remarks on its usefulness.

**Uses-**

It could be used in a primitive calculating machine, most modern computers use binary encoding for instructions and data. Telephone calls are carried digitally on long-distance and mobile phone networks using pulse code modulation on voice over IP network.
