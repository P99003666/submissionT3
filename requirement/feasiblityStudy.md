  Feasibility Study

  1. Technical Feasibility

  Number Conversion System is a tool used for converting a decimal number to its respective binary number and vice versa. The main technology and tools that are associated with Number Conversion System are
	
    2.1 C Programming  
	  2.2 Visual Code Studio
  
  The above requirements are freely available and skills required for this are manageable. Time limit limitations of the product development and the ease of implementing using these technologies are synchronized.
  From the above statements it is clear that the project Number Conversion System is technically feasible.

  
  2. Operational Feasibility

  This project provides a very user friendly way to interact with the customer. Any user who does not have any understanding of programming technologies can also use this. We have allowed users to give text based inputs so that they can easily use this tool and this makes it more user friendly. Even normal people who are not familiar with technology can also use this application and perform the operations defined by us.
  It is clear from the above explanation that the project is operationally feasible. Technical Feasibility

  
  3. Resource Feasibility

  Resources that are required for Number Conversion System includes
  
    3.1 Programming Devices (Laptops)
  
    3.2 Code Editors	
  
    3.3 Programming individuals
  
  The above mentioned resources are easily available and hence it is clear that the project is resource feasible.

 
  4. Financial Feasibility

  Being a Number Conversion System tool it will not require any type of hosting. Since it is not operable via internet hence it doesn't require bandwidth and internet usage.
  Bug fixing and maintaining tasks will have an associated cost. At the initial stage the potential market place will be some secondary and high schools. Later on market place will be expanded to colleges and local public.
  Significantly it will reduce the efforts made by people to solve such kind of conversion problems as the conversion will be input based and fully automated.
  From these points it is clear that project Number Conversion System is financially feasible.
